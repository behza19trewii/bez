git init
git remote add origin <https://github.com/behza19trewii/bez.git

git checkout -b name_of_branch 
or 
git branch <branch name>

--------------------------------
Option 4: Creating a branch from another branch
This example shows creating the feature4 branch from the develop branch.

git checkout -b feature4 develop
------------------------------
git add .
git commit -m "_completely NONE WARNING _ensure that date ad time is string"
git push -u origin name_of_branch
---------------------------------------
Merging that branch into main (on remote)

Once you’re ready to merge your work back into main:

1️⃣ Switch to main
git checkout main

2️⃣ Update main (optional)
git pull origin main

3️⃣ Merge the branch
git merge v2

4️⃣ Push the updated main branch
git push origin main
-------------------------------------
Deleting a branch locally
Ensure you are not on the branch you want to delete: Switch to a different
branch, typically the main branch:
1️⃣
git checkout main


Delete the branch locally: Use the git branch -d <branch-name> command for
a safe deletion that checks for unmerged changes, or git branch -D <branch-name> to force the deletion:
2️⃣
git branch -d feature-branch


Push the deletion to GitHub: To remove the branch from your remote GitHub
repository, use:
3️⃣
git push origin --delete feature-branch
